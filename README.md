Danubi

What is it?
---

**Danubi** is the name of the **bat/ghost-esque character** I created sometimes in May 2016. 

This repository contains the **Processing and P5.js programs** you can execute to generate **random instances** of Danubi.

With every click on the screen, a new **combination of body type and colors** will be generated.

There are two types of Danubi bodies: one with **wings** and one without.

Why was it created?
---

I was thinking about a really simple **logo for my projects** featuring a bit of randomness, so I started writing some code in **Processing**.

The result is what you can see here today, very little changed from the first version of the program.

Can anyone use the program or the logo for their projects?

Yes, as long as the [GNU GPL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pitou/danubi/master) is being respected.

I'd be very glad to be informed if you intend to modify and redistribute this program for any purpose.
